## DES 499 - Jantar Mantar Reconstruction

As a part of this project course we're expected to create a physically precise interactive model of the various yantras at [Jantar Mantar](https://www.jantarmantar.org/) in Unity.  This project is being mentored by [Sameer Sahasrabudhe](https://iitgn.ac.in/faculty/design/sameer).

### 1.0 Week - 1

### 1.1 Day & Night Cycles
 My job was to script the day & night cycles in Unity (need not be physically precise initially).
 * I used a Procedural Sky shader for skybox as it comes with a sun that mimics the directional light by default.
 * Then I bound the directional light's rotation and intensity, fog color and a clock to the day & night cycle.
